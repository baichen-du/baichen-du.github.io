Hello! I am a PhD student at <a href="https://linguistics.ucla.edu/"> UCLA Linguistics</a>, specializing in Phonetics and Phonology. I study how the structure and fine details of language are produced, perceived, acquired, and changed with various methodologies, such as experimentation, computation, and fieldwork. For example, I study the role of phonology when interacting with perceptibility, articulation, lexical access and variation, and how this role may inform our understanding of grammatical theory. Currently, I am a member of the <a href = "https://phonetics.linguistics.ucla.edu/">UCLA Phonetics Lab </a>. My thesis is advised by <a href = "https://linguistics.ucla.edu/person/megha-sundara/"> Megha Sundara</a> and <a href = "https://kiezuraw.com/"> Kie Zuraw</a> (co-chair). I worked on a number of projects with <a href = "https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/persons/yao-yao"> Yao Yao</a>, <a href="https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~kjohnson/"> Keith Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.alexandra-pfiffner.com/"> Alexandra Pfiffner</a>, and <a href="https://Jhavenhill.com"> Jonathan Havenhill</a>. For more details, see my <a href="https://baichen-du.github.io/assets/files/cv/main.pdf">CV</a>.

## Additional Notes

<div style="text-align: justify">
My name is spelled as Paak San Dou [pak3 sɐn21 tou2] in Cantonese. Prior to joining UCLA, I worked as a full-time research assistant at the Speech and Language Science lab at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong, and at the Psychology Department at University of Manitoba - Winnipeg before completing my study abroad at UC Berkeley. I also enjoy applying data analytics and machine learning techniques to linguistic research.
