Hello! I am a PhD student at <a href="https://linguistics.ucla.edu/"> UCLA Linguistics</a>, specializing in Phonetics. I study how the structure and fine details of language are produced, perceived, acquired, and changed with various methodologies, such as expreimentation, computation, and filedworks. For example, I study the role of phonology when interacting with perceptibility, articulation, lexical access and variation, and how such role may inform us of the theory of grammar. Currently, I am a member of the <a href = "https://phonetics.linguistics.ucla.edu/">UCLA Phonetics Lab </a>. I worked on a number of projects on these topics with <a href = "https://linguistics.ucla.edu/person/megha-sundara/"> Megha Sundara</a>, <a href = "https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/persons/yao-yao"> Yao Yao</a>, <a href="https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~kjohnson/"> Keith Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.alexandra-pfiffner.com/"> Alexandra Pfiffner</a>, and <a href="https://Jhavenhill.com"> Jonathan Havenhill</a>.

## Additional Notes

<div style="text-align: justify">
I also speak Cantonese, in which my name is spelled as Paak San Dou [pak3 sɐn21 tou2]. Prior to joining UCLA, I worked as a full-time research assistant at the Speech and Language Science lab at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong, and at the Psychology Department in University of Manitoba - Winnipeg before completing my exchange study at UC Berkeley. Aside from phonetics, I also enjoy applying data analytics and machine learning techniques to linguistic research.

## Recent News

<div style="text-align: justify">
Collaborating with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jlsiah/home">Jian-Leat Siah</a> and Jae-Eun Jennifer Shin, I will be on a fieldwork trip this winter to Tawau, Malaysia, to investigate the endangered languages of Kalabakan Murut and Serudung Murut, their unique repair strategies in the coda voicing, and the resulting perceptual differences. This trip is sponsored by the <a href="https://linguistics.ucla.edu/graduate/current-students/ladefoged-scholarship-official-page/"> two Ladefoged Scholarships</a> awarded to Jian-Leat, and co-award to me and Jennifer.
